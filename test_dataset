Rachel: C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!
Beyond the urban sprawl, the landscape unveils its breathtaking beauty. Rolling hills adorned with vineyards lead to rugged coastlines where turquoise waters lap against pristine beaches. Ancient villages nestled amidst olive groves offer a glimpse into traditional Spain, where time seems to stand still and the warmth of the people shines brighter than the sun. In the south, the legacy of Andalusia lives on, its flamenco rhythms pulsating through the air, its Moorish architecture whispering tales of a vibrant past, and its bullfighting arenas showcasing the courage and skill of matadors.

Elara clutched the tattered leather pouch containing the few remaining Alaria Texts, their ancient script barely visible under the relentless erosion of sand and time. These texts held the secrets of her people's magic, the delicate balance between the elements that had sustained Alaria for centuries. If she lost them, the knowledge would be lost forever, plunging Alaria into an age of darkness and decay.

Researchers at MIT have developed a new artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm capable of predicting crime with remarkable accuracy. The algorithm analyzes data from various sources, including social media, police reports, and weather patterns, to identify areas with a high risk of crime.

The move comes amid mounting pressure from governments and civil society groups to hold social media platforms accountable for the content they host.
Monica: Oh, I was hoping you wouldn't remember.
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See?

Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think?

At night, the city transformed into a sparkling wonderland. Neon signs illuminated the streets, and restaurants buzzed with diners enjoying cuisine from around the world. Nightclubs and bars beckoned those seeking entertainment and a lively atmosphere.

In computing, plain text is a loose term for data (e.g. file contents) that represent only characters of readable material but not its graphical representation nor other objects (floating-point numbers, images, etc.). It may also include a limited number of "whitespace" characters that affect simple arrangement of text, such as spaces, line breaks, or tabulation characters. Plain text is different from formatted text, where style information is included; from structured text, where structural parts of the document such as paragraphs, sections, and the like are identified; and from binary files in which some portions must be interpreted as binary objects (encoded integers, real numbers, images, etc.).

The near-ubiquity of ASCII was a great help, but failed to address international and linguistic concerns. The dollar-sign ("$") was not as useful in England, and the accented characters used in Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, and many other languages were entirely unavailable in ASCII (not to mention characters used in Greek, Russian, and most Eastern languages). Many individuals, companies, and countries defined extra characters as needed—often reassigning control characters, or using values in the range from 128 to 255. Using values above 128 conflicts with using the 8th bit as a checksum, but the checksum usage gradually died out.

Phoebe: (sings) I can't believe what I'm hearing here...

There are several potential dangers associated with the widespread use of facial recognition technology. First, it could be used to track individuals without their knowledge or consent. Second, it could be used to discriminate against individuals based on their race, gender, or other personal characteristics. Third, it could be used to restrict freedom of speech and assembly.

Kiki: Waitressing?



Chandler: Hey, look, we're on that TV thing!

Elara's once-vibrant green eyes were now clouded with fatigue and despair. The weight of her burden, the last remnants of her people's ancient knowledge, pressed heavily upon her. The Alchemists of Alaria, once revered for their mastery of the elements and their ability to heal the land, were now hunted and ostracized, their magic deemed too powerful, too unpredictable by the tyrannical King Azrael.

The outcome of these investigations could have significant implications for the future of the tech industry. They could lead to a more fragmented tech landscape, with smaller companies having a greater chance of success.
Receptionist: (sarcastic) Oh, that's attractive.
Chandler: Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too.

Iceland was a place of epic landscapes and geological wonders. Glaciers carved through mountains, and icebergs drifted in icy lagoons. Geysers shot boiling water and steam into the air, erupting with unceasing regularity. Waterfalls cascaded from immense heights, creating rainbows that seemed to touch the ground.

Rachel: Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor. (Monica smiles.) What?

All: Yeah...
Rachel: Hello, Paul.





Rachel: Anyway, um, (Gets the ring out of her purse.) I guess this belongs to you. And thank you for giving it to me.

The chatbot, named Bard, was able to engage in extended conversations with humans on a variety of topics, indistinguishably from a real person. This raises concerns about the potential for malicious actors to use AI to spread misinformation and propaganda.
