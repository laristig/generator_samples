The local villages, nestled in the valleys, were a testament to human resilience. Their terraced fields produced vital crops, and they traded in yak wool, salt, and other goods. Festivals were celebrated with colorful costumes, lively dances, and traditional music that resonated through the valleys.
Joey: You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!
(Rachel goes into her room and Monica enters the living room as Ross is leaving.)
Chandler: I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.
[Scene: Chandler's office, Chandler looks around, opens his desk drawer, takes a puff of a cigarette, sprays around some air freshener, and takes some breath spray.  He types for a little while, opens the drawer again, and takes another drag of the cigarette.   While not paying attention, he sprays the breath spray around the room, takes a squirt of air freshener and gags.]

Rachel: (miserably) No, no, that's not what we ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese.
Phoebe: Oh, yeah!
Susan: Ross.
Chandler: Oh, how well you know me...
Phoebe: Hey, Lizzie.
Before the early 1960s, computers were mainly used for number-crunching rather than for text, and memory was extremely expensive. Computers often allocated only 6 bits for each character, permitting only 64 characters—assigning codes for A-Z, a-z, and 0-9 would leave only 2 codes: nowhere near enough. Most computers opted not to support lower-case letters. Thus, early text projects such as Roberto Busa's Index Thomisticus, the Brown Corpus, and others had to resort to conventions such as keying an asterisk preceding letters actually intended to be upper-case.
Rachel: I did.
Joey: Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're gonna start with that stuff we're outta here.

Phoebe: Oh, that's fine, no.

Joey: C'mon, Ross!
Mark: You're welcome, young lady. Now, how about another cup of coffee? It's on me.
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.)


Chandler: You're right, I'm sorry. (Burst into song and dances out of the door.) "Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy..."




Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Mark: We all get caught up in the rat race sometimes. But it's important to take a step back and remind ourselves what truly matters.
Joey: (shouting to Chandler) Chandler! He's here!
Monica: What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.



In the heart of the mystical Sahara Desert, where endless sand dunes met the horizon, life unfolded in the shadow of the eternal sun. The Sahara was a land of vast, undulating landscapes, where the silence was only occasionally interrupted by the whisper of the wind and the cry of desert wildlife.
Eleanor (20s): Fiery and determined owner of The Last Drip, a skilled barista with a passion for freedom.
[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is telling everyone about her discovery.]
Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...


Phoebe: I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker!
End


Phoebe: All right, c'mere, gimme your feet. (She starts massaging them.)
Paul: Ever since she walked out on me, I, uh...
This is just a sample conversation, and you can modify it to your liking. You can change the setting, characters, and topics of conversation to create different daily life scenarios. The key is to make the dialogue sound natural and engaging, and to capture the essence of everyday human interaction.
Phoebe: You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel.


Ross: Well..
Mrs. Geller: Nothing! It's an expression.





Phoebe: Yes, 'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them.
Ross: (points) Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-


(Rachel runs up cluching an envelope.)
Suddenly, the door bursts open and a figure strides in, his face etched with grim determination. It's Agent Thorne, a man feared and respected for his ruthless enforcement of the coffee ban. His presence instantly silences the room, replacing the murmur of conversation with a tense silence.





Monica: Yes!

Carol: As in my grandmother.

Ross: The way he makes me feel about myself.


At night, Madagascar was a chorus of nocturnal creatures, including the indri, the largest of the lemurs, with its haunting call. The Malagasy nights were illuminated by the moonlight, and stars filled the sky, making it an ideal destination for stargazing.
All: Okayyy! (They do so.)
Monica: (dubious) I understand.

Mr. Geller: (To Ross) Do you remember the Ludwins? The big one had a thing for you, didn't she?
[Scene: Carol's OB/GYN, they're still arguing about what to name the baby.]


Ross: Then don't do that, alright?

Only time will tell whether the Paris summit will succeed in forging a global agreement capable of curbing climate change. The future of our planet hangs in the balance.

Inside, the walls of the monastery were adorned with intricate murals, depicting the life of the Buddha and the legends of their order. A sense of tranquility and mysticism pervaded the air as the monks chanted and prayed.



Ross: Carol was wearing boots just like those the night that we- we first- y'know. Fact, she, uh- she never took'em off, 'cause we-we- (off Chandler's look) Sorry. Sorry.

Monica: Alright, we have to talk.


Chandler: (deadpan) Yes, and we're very excited about it.

(Joey lets his wrist go limp.)
All: Hey, Pheebs! Hi!


The open-source programming language Rust is rapidly gaining popularity among developers due to its unique combination of speed, memory safety, and expressiveness. Rust is particularly well-suited for developing system-level software, such as operating systems and embedded systems.
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.)



(Monica stomps on Paul's watch and goes into her room.)
Phoebe: I remember the day I got my first pay check. There was a cave in in one of the mines, and eight people were killed.
Majestic rivers snaked through the dense vegetation, home to piranhas, electric eels, and pink river dolphins. The lush undergrowth concealed colorful poison dart frogs, while howler monkeys and toucans provided the soundtrack of the jungle.



Barry: No. I went with, uh.. Now, this may hurt.

A new AI-powered chatbot developed by OpenAI has reportedly passed the Turing test, a benchmark designed to assess whether a machine can exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to a human. This raises significant ethical concerns about the potential for AI to deceive and manipulate humans.
Indigenous tribes, whose roots stretched back through generations, inhabited the rainforest. They possessed a deep understanding of the forest's secrets, relying on its resources for their survival. Their knowledge included the use of medicinal plants and a profound spiritual connection with the natural world.
The developers of the algorithm insist that it is designed to be unbiased and impartial. Nevertheless, they acknowledge the need for careful implementation and ongoing monitoring to ensure that this powerful technology is used responsibly.


(Chandler lights a cigarette.)


The Sahara was a realm of solitude and wonder, where humans and nature coexisted in a delicate balance. Your RNN model can use this descriptive text to predict the next word in sentences, allowing it to generate evocative descriptions of the Sahara Desert and the unique way of life that exists in this arid expanse.

In today's fast-paced world, it is more important than ever to make time for reading. Whether it's a classic novel, a thrilling mystery, or a thought-provoking non-fiction book, there's a book out there for everyone. So put down your phone, pick up a book, and rediscover the magic of reading.
Monica: (turns off the TV) Okay..
Monica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.













Monica: We thought since Phoebe was staying over tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing. We got some trashy magazines, we got cookie dough, we got Twister... (The phone rings and Monica answers it.)

Ross: Goodnight.



Ross: Hi. (He is wearing a piece of steel bandaged to his nose.  He tosses some forms onto reception desk.)
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...?

Ross: It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again.

Rachel: The lights, please..

(Monica laughs and snorts.)

Joey: Man. Can you believe he's only had sex with one woman?






All: Yeah. Yeah, I'll have a cup of coffee.
Ross: Split it?



Mr. Geller: Look, there are people like Ross who need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other people are satisfied with staying where they are- I'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer.
Monica: Oh, y'know..



Monica: Well, unless goose is a vegetable...ha haaaah!
Rachel: I'm just serving it.

(Phoebe enters, walks to the couch, sits down, and begins to read a letter without saying hi.)
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch.




Ross: Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing.
Monica: (taking a drink from Joey) Are you through with that?
The Sahara was also home to a remarkable diversity of wildlife. Fennec foxes, meerkats, and sand gazelles adapted to the arid conditions, while desert birds like the Egyptian vulture and the hoopoe soared in the skies. At night, the desert was a realm of nocturnal creatures, including the elusive Saharan cheetah.

At night, the Sahara transformed into a celestial wonderland. The sky was an uninterrupted canvas of stars, and the silence of the desert was only occasionally broken by the call of nocturnal creatures. Campfires flickered, and travelers shared stories under the infinite night sky.
Monica: Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., "I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren." was what?  A wrong number?
Chandler: Kids, new dream... I'm in Las Vegas. (Rachel sits down to hear Chandler's dream.)
(The gang swaps all the drinks for what they ordered as Phoebe enters.  She sits down without saying hi.)

Mr. Geller: Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have been! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...
Barry: Yeah! It's fine, it's fine. Robbie's gonna be here for hours.


Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this.

Chandler: So in your whole life, you've only been with one—(He gets a look too)—oh.
Joey: Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?




Monica: No it's not.

Australia, a land of contrasts and endless possibilities, is more than just a vacation destination; it's an experience that stays with you long after you've left its shores. It's a land that awakens the senses, ignites the spirit of adventure, and leaves you yearning to return and discover its hidden wonders.

In the heart of Germany, ancient cathedrals and opulent palaces stand as testaments to a rich cultural heritage. The echoes of Bach's compositions resonate within grand halls, while the stories of Goethe and Schiller continue to inspire generations. In the tranquil countryside, rolling vineyards yield world-renowned wines, while charming villages nestled amidst rolling hills offer a glimpse into a slower pace of life.
(There's a knock on the door, Chandler opens it, and silently hands back the cushion.)

[Scene Central Perk, everyone's there.]
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age.



[Time lapse, Alan is leaving.]
All: Yeah, drop it! Drop the towel! Please drop the—(pause)—wowww.


Ross: He finally asked you out?
Carol: Ross? That opens my cervix. (He drops it in horror.)
Rachel: What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?
Joey: Thanks! Let's keep going.


Ross: Pregnant?!
Joey: I say push her down the stairs.


Monica: Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?


At night, the Icelandic skies became a canvas for the Northern Lights. These ethereal curtains of light danced in shades of green and pink, captivating those who witnessed the celestial display. In remote cabins and cozy cottages, travelers shared stories while sipping on Brennivín, the traditional Icelandic schnapps.

Rachel: Oh, I am sorry...

Robbie: Me. (Spits.)
Sarah: I will. Thank you again for everything.
Robbie: Me?!
(There's a knock on the door and it's Paul.)

(Barry and Rachel look at each other.)
Joey: Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live!
Barry: You know, you were right? I mean, I thought we were happy. We weren't happy. But with Mindy, now I'm happy. Spit.

Ross: (Doing the spinning) Okay, Monica: Right foot red.
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back..

The Google AI team's breakthrough involved using a 53-qubit quantum processor to perform a specific task that would take a classical computer billions of years to complete. This demonstrates the immense potential of quantum computing to solve complex problems that are currently intractable.
All: Oh, come on! Come on!
Barry: Careful! They haven't quite taken yet.



Monica: Hey. It's him. (On the intercom) Who is it?
Susan: Yeah, and we all know what a challenge that is!

Paul: Two years.

Mark: (Looks up from his book with a smile) Rough day?

The use of plain text rather than binary files enables files to survive much better "in the wild", in part by making them largely immune to computer architecture incompatibilities. For example, all the problems of Endianness can be avoided (with encodings such as UCS-2 rather than UTF-8, endianness matters, but uniformly for every character, rather than for potentially-unknown subsets of it).
Rachel: Ugh. (To another customer that's leaving.) Excuse me, could you give this to that guy over there? (Hands him the coffee pot.) Go ahead. (He does so.) Thank you. (To the gang.) Sorry.  Okay, Las Vegas.
Ross: (tries to snatch it from the kid) GIVE ME MY PUCK!! (but it files out of his grasp and knocks out the receptionist)


Explorers journeyed to Madagascar to witness its otherworldly landscapes. The surreal limestone formations of Tsingy de Bemaraha created a maze of jagged spires. The pristine beaches and coral reefs offered world-class diving and snorkeling experiences.


All: Oh! That was Lambchop!

Ross: Actually, nectarines, but basically...



Chandler: Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please?
Monica: Wow, you worked in a mine?

Monica: Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!
Rachel: So, whaddya think George is like?
The purpose of using plain text today is primarily independence from programs that require their very own special encoding or formatting or file format. Plain text files can be opened, read, and edited with ubiquitous text editors and utilities.
Rachel: Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.

(An awkward silence ensues.)




Rachel: I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to bring you down.





Ross: (squatting and reading the instructions) I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.


(She is pushed down the stairs and everyone cheers.)


Ross: Look, it's just a little more complicated...


Monica: Okay. It's-it's about Alan. There's something that you should know. I mean, there's really no easy way to say this.. uh.. I've decided to break up with Alan.
Sarah: (Sighs deeply, rubbing her tired eyes) Ugh, this report is never going to finish itself.
Chandler: (leaving) I don't care, I don't care! Game's over! I'm weak! I've gotta smoke! I've gotta have the smoke!
Monica: My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?
The book explores themes of self-discovery, pursuing dreams, and the importance of listening to one's intuition. It delves into the concept of personal legend, the unique path that each individual is destined to follow.
Ross: You guys.


Alan: Yeah, I'm sorry too. But, I gotta tell you, I am a little relieved.
Joey: What, like there's a rule or something?


Paul: No, I'm telling you last night was like umm, all my birthdays, both graduations, plus the barn raising scene in Witness.

Chandler: Yes, Bunny?
[SCENE START]
Monica: -but that wouldn't be fair to me, it wouldn't be fair to Alan- It wouldn't be fair to you!
Ross: Can I use.. either thumb?
Chandler: (to Joey) Could've been a peach.
Monica: C'mon!

Rachel: I'm- uh- I'm okay... You look great!
Chandler: (stops) I have no idea.




Rachel: Yeah.
High in the Himalayan mountains, where the air was thin and frigid, an ancient monastery clung to the edge of a precipitous cliff. The monks who resided there dedicated their lives to meditation, seeking spiritual enlightenment. The monastery was a place of breathtaking natural beauty, with snow-capped peaks, prayer flags fluttering in the wind, and the distant sound of ringing bells.


The Last Alchemist of Alaria
Rachel: Look-look-look-look-look, my first pay check! Look at the window, there's my name! Hi, me!




Carol: Sorry. You look good too.

Ross: Aw, Mom...

Ross: (in a deep voice) I'll have whatever Christine is having.
All: Morning. Good morning.

Phoebe: Oh, wait, she's walking across the floor.. she's walking.. she's walking.. she's going for the pizza- (Yelling) Hey, that's not for you, bitch! (Phoebe covers her mouth with her hand walks away from the window.)
Phoebe: She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- (Monica glares at her.) -but, it's fine!
Monica: You know Paul?

Chandler: Hey!
Monica: That's right. [Scene: Monica's Apartment, Rachel is talking on the phone and pacing.]
Ross: Okay, Pheebs: Right hand blue. (Phoebe has to bend over.)Good. (Joey stares at her butt appreciatively)

Ross: Does she.



At night, the islands transformed into a realm of tranquility. The low-hanging clouds parted to reveal a star-studded sky, where the Northern Lights danced in vibrant colors. The villages came alive with the glow of cozy, candlelit pubs where locals shared stories and music.
Chandler: (returns) Yeah, alright.

All: Yes!

Joanne: Alright. Let's talk reality for a second.
(They give each other a dubious look.)
Ross: Pass it! Pass it!


Monica: You actually broke her watch?  Wow!  The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by boyfriend's favorite bath towel.
Ross: Alright, alright, maybe it'll take my mind off it. Do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger?

[Scene: Madison Square Garden, the guys are trying to find their seats.]




Bhutan was a realm of spiritual harmony and environmental stewardship, where ancient traditions and a focus on happiness coexisted. Your RNN model can use this text to predict the next word in sentences, allowing it to generate evocative descriptions of Bhutan and the unique culture and environment of this Himalayan kingdom.

The Faroe Islands were also a paradise for birdwatchers and naturalists. The sheer cliffs teemed with seabirds, including puffins, guillemots, and kittiwakes, nesting on narrow ledges. The air was filled with the chorus of birdcalls, creating a symphony unique to this remote corner of the world.

Carol: Give me a 'for instance'.




The benefits of reading are not just anecdotal. Numerous studies have shown that regular reading can improve cognitive function, reduce stress, and boost mental well-being. It can also help to build vocabulary, improve communication skills, and promote a lifelong love of learning.




Monica: Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. (They are all lined up next to the door.)... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.

Chandler: I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking.
Monica: Do you all promise?
Monica:  Rachel!  That was a library card!
Mr. Geller: ...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem.
From the sun-drenched shores of the Mediterranean to the snow-capped peaks of the Pyrenees, Spain unfolds like a vibrant tapestry woven with threads of history, culture, and passion. The air shimmers with the scent of orange groves and the earthy aroma of Rioja, while flamenco guitars weave their melodies through bustling squares and hidden alleyways. Here, the echoes of ancient empires reverberate through majestic castles and cathedrals, whispers of conquistadors mingling with the rhythmic chants of bullfighters and the laughter of children playing in sun-drenched plazas.



Chandler: Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... (sees that Monica is glaring at him) ...now I wish I was dead.

Visitors from around the world embarked on treks to reach Machu Picchu, following the ancient Inca Trail that wound through lush cloud forests and across rickety bridges. The journey was an exploration of the senses, as orchids and colorful butterflies adorned the path, and the sound of rushing rivers provided a soothing background melody.
Sarah: (Takes the book) I'll definitely give it a try. Thank you for the recommendation.
Rachel: Isn't this amazing? I mean, I have never made coffee before in my entire life.
Ross: If only he were a woman.

Phoebe: She is so great! I miss her.



Plain text is also sometimes used only to exclude "binary" files: those in which at least some parts of the file cannot be correctly interpreted via the character encoding in effect. For example, a file or string consisting of "hello" (in any encoding), following by 4 bytes that express a binary integer that is not a character, is a binary file. Converting a plain text file to a different character encoding does not change the meaning of the text, as long as the correct character encoding is used. However, converting a binary file to a different format may alter the interpretation of the non-textual data.



As the sun dipped below the sand dunes, the Sahara's colors transformed into a breathtaking display. The sky was painted with vivid oranges and purples, and the stars emerged in all their brilliance. It was a place where the celestial beauty of the night sky was unparalleled.

All: Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut..

Monica: (to Alan) Thanks. I'll call you tomorrow. (Alan exits, to all) Okay. Okay, let's let the Alan-bashing begin. Who's gonna take the first shot, hmm?
[Scene: Central Perk, everyone is there.]
Phoebe:...Then I've already seen this one! (Turns off the TV.)


Rachel: Wow.


At night, Machu Picchu was a place of serenity. The Milky Way stretched across the heavens, and the ruins were illuminated by the soft glow of lanterns. Visitors meditated on the terraces, gazing out at the starlit landscape and contemplating the mysteries of this ancient city.
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.)

Monica: Oh, that's nice!
Monica: You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?
Rachel: Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone.

Processed foods are often high in unhealthy fats, sodium, and sugar, all of which have been linked to an increased risk of chronic diseases, including cancer.
Monica: So what, you're not the only one. I mean, half the time we don't know where we're going. You've just gotta figure at some point it's all gonna come together, and it's just gonna be... un-floopy.
Joey: Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.
(Chandler tries to shrug nonchalantly but eventually he has to exhale a mouthful of smoke.)
Chandler: And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.
Joey: Oh, (Imitating Ross) "you do, do you"?






Monica: You can, I know you can!
Ross: Is there somebody else?

Chandler: Okay. "So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?"

Immerse yourself in the chanting of monks, the flickering of butter lamps, and the peaceful aura that permeates the air.

Rachel: I'm all better now.
Monica: ..I dunno, a little too Alan?
Joey: Listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make like a Western omelet or something... (Joey and Chandler taste the coffee, grimace, and pour it into a plant pot.) Although actually I'm really not that hungry...

The book is renowned for its sharp observations of human behavior, witty dialogue, and captivating love story. It explores themes of social class, gender roles, and the importance of judging individuals based on their character rather than their social standing.

Phoebe: Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.

Monica: Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...

Paula: Waitwait.. we talking about the coyotes here? All right, a cow got through!


Monica: Can you believe it? ...Y'know what? I just don't feel the thing. I mean, they feel the thing, I don't feel the thing.
Phoebe: I worked in a Dairy Queen, why?

Chandler: Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.

[Time Lapse, Rachel is breating into a paper bag.]
Monica: Okay, umm-umm, I'll just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah...

Beyond the natural beauty and vibrant culture, Australia's welcoming spirit and friendly people make it a truly special place. From sharing a cup of coffee with a local barista to joining a friendly game of cricket on the beach, Australians embrace visitors with open arms and a genuine desire to share their unique way of life.



The text-encoding situation became more and more complex, leading to efforts by ISO and by the Unicode Consortium to develop a single, unified character encoding that could cover all known (or at least all currently known) languages. After some conflict,[citation needed] these efforts were unified. Unicode currently allows for 1,114,112 code values, and assigns codes covering nearly all modern text writing systems, as well as many historical ones, and for many non-linguistic characters such as printer's dingbats, mathematical symbols, etc.
Plain text files are almost universal in programming; a source code file containing instructions in a programming language is almost always a plain text file. Plain text is also commonly used for configuration files, which are read for saved settings at the startup of a program.

Eleanor nods, her movements a symphony of precision as she grinds the beans, measures the water, and extracts the perfect cup of coffee.

Fred Brooks of IBM argued strongly for going to 8-bit bytes, because someday people might want to process text and won. Although IBM used EBCDIC, most text from then on came to be encoded in ASCII, using values from 0 to 31 for (non-printing) control characters, and values from 32 to 127 for graphic characters such as letters, digits, and punctuation. Most machines stored characters in 8 bits rather than 7, ignoring the remaining bit or using it as a checksum.

These additional characters were encoded differently in different countries, making texts impossible to decode without figuring out the originator's rules. For instance, a browser might display ¬A rather than ` if it tried to interpret one character set as another. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) eventually developed several code pages under ISO 8859, to accommodate various languages. The first of these (ISO 8859-1) is also known as "Latin-1", and covers the needs of most (not all) European languages that use Latin-based characters (there was not quite enough room to cover them all). ISO 2022 then provided conventions for "switching" between different character sets in mid-file. Many other organisations developed variations on these, and for many years Windows and Macintosh computers used incompatible variations.
